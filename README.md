# Globe Weather App

This is a cool web app that shows a 3D rotating Earth globe! You can search for any city, and it will zoom in to show the weather details like temperature, humidity, and more.

## What It Does
- Shows a 3D Earth that spins slowly.
- Lets you type a city name to zoom in and see its weather.
- Displays weather info like temperature, how it feels, humidity, rain, weather type, sunrise, sunset, and wind speed.
- Moves back to the full Earth view when you clear the search.

## How to Use
- Type a city name (like "London" or "New York") in the search box at the top.
- Press Enter or wait a second. The Earth will zoom to that city, and weather info will show on the right.
- Clear the search box to zoom out and see the full Earth again.

## Things to Know
- The app uses a free weather API, so it has limits (1,000 calls per day).
- The API key in the code is just an example. For your own app, use a new key and keep it safe.
- If the globe looks black, check your internet or try a different browser.

## Made With
